				<!-- rough edit
					 I have experience primarily scripting with Python and working on web applications and have long-term goals of creating large-scale and interactive products with a diverse and passionate team.
					psychology!
				driven to produce elegant, efficient, and effective solutions to clients and customers

				-concise code
				-problem solving abilities and pattern recognition
				My expertise is in Java development, 
				critical-thinking, and a great team player/collaborator/
				Specialty: Java Development, scalable front-end work, fearless approach in people skills,


				I pride myself in communication skills, as that can determine how efficient and effortles/concise the workflow can be.
	
				The approach i liek to take when taking on jobs is to figure out the most i can about a task and what is related to it, even trivial details,
				so i can best discover what code or approach i can take is best.
				I am a firm believer in trying to eliminate potential problems from the get-go so there is less fixes that have to be done later.

				As software is always in development, its important to keep in times with technology.
				As a person who frequently bridges between Us and Japan, I see that Japan, althought it was booming in 90s with Sony being the flagship and coined "Japanese tech = quality," the progress of Japanese technology slowly progressed over time.
				My theory of why this is, from psychological and sociological perspective, is because Japanese culture is heavily reliant on tradition and what's tried n true. Why reinvent the wheel when it works? is the thought in Japanese society. As honorable as this is, it hasn;t seemed to work in basis of technology. I find the User efficiency in japanese apps and websites are horrible structured, and way too complicated.
				If you check out Yahoo! news Japan, which is the one of the top news media outlet in Japan, you will be surprised to see that the website will throw you back to the early 2000s, when AOL was still poppin, and would be unexpected from what was once the forefront of technology.

				I find that to be a software engineer, we have to be a student first, and to never lose the spirit and interest in learning.
				Like a software, "software is constantly in development or deprecated," we as the creators of software also must always have the spirit in being a student.
